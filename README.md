Bine - A terminal binary editor
================================

![ScreenShot](./screenshot.png)

Key Features
------------

* **Fast startup with asynchronous loading**
  The viewer launches instantly and loads data in the background, allowing immediate interaction even with large files.

* **Supports both files and standard input**
  `bine` can read binary data not only from files but also from standard input, making it easy to use in pipelines.

* **Vi-style navigation**
  Navigation keys follow the familiar `vi` keybindings (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, etc.), allowing smooth movement for experienced users.  
(Note: File name input uses Emacs-style key bindings.)

* **Split-view with hex and character representations**
  The screen is divided approximately 2:1 between hexadecimal and character views. Supported encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16 (LE/BE), and the current Windows code page. You can switch encoding on the fly with key commands.

* **Smart decoding with character annotations**
  Multi-byte characters are visually grouped based on byte structure. Special code points such as BOMs and control characters (e.g., newlines) are annotated with readable names or symbols, making it easier to understand mixed binary/text content and debug encoding issues.

* **Minimal screen usage**
  `bine` only uses as many terminal lines as needed (1 line = 16 bytes), without occupying the full screen. This makes it easy to inspect or edit small binary data while still seeing the surrounding terminal output.

* **Cross-platform**
  Written in Go, `bine` runs on both Windows and Linux. It should also build and work on other Unix-like systems.

Install
--------

### Manual installation

Download the binary package from [Releases](https://github.com/hymkor/binview/releases) and extract the executable.

<!-- pwsh -Command "readme-install.ps1" | -->

### Use [eget] installer (cross-platform)

```sh
brew install eget        # Unix-like systems
# or
scoop install eget       # Windows

cd (YOUR-BIN-DIRECTORY)
eget hymkor/binview
```

[eget]: https://github.com/zyedidia/eget

### Use [scoop]-installer (Windows only)

```
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hymkor/binview/master/binview.json
```

or

```
scoop bucket add hymkor https://github.com/hymkor/scoop-bucket
scoop install binview
```

[scoop]: https://scoop.sh/

### Use "go install" (requires Go toolchain)

```
go install github.com/hymkor/binview@latest
```

Because `go install` introduces the executable into `$HOME/go/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin`, you need to add this directory to your `$PATH` to execute `binview`.
